Hi

I am a final year RF engineering student and an electronics hobbyist. I am much more interested and invested in electronics and Digital Signal Processing.

Here are some of my Vivado VHDL projects using the NEXYS A7 (Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA XC7A100T-1CSG324) FPGA board. Most of my projects will be freely accessible but some of them will be password protected. Access will be granted depending on the reasons for which you would want to access them.

Some of them just cover basic digital electronics design but most of them will be more about Digital Signal Processing. I will add some of my MATLAB projects and simulink models soon and I will provide some MATLAB generated HDL (I will probably explain how you can use MATLAB and Vivado for such projects). 

I use the Digilent's NEXYS A7 (Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA XC7A100T-1CSG324) FPGA board but you are free to alter the code or the constraints to meet your needs and/or your hardware requirements. 

You can contact me at kktafadzwa@gmail.com should you have any questions, contributions or should you require some help. I might not instantly respond but i will. You should however note that I will only respond to mails written in English or Russian Languages.

I will be adding some projects that will be open for collaboration. Stay around for more.

Have fun!!
